"Subheading Notes.
1.- In this Section and, where applicable, throughout the Nomenclature, the
following expressions have the meanings hereby assigned to them:
(a) Unbleached yarn
Yarn which:
(i) has the natural colour of its constituent fibres and has
not been bleached, dyed (whether or not in the mass)
or printed; or
(ii) is of indeterminate colour (""grey yarn""), manufactured
from garnetted stock.
Such yarn may have been treated with a colourless
dressing or fugitive dye (which disappears after simple
washing with soap) and, in the case of man-made
fibres, treated in the mass with delustring agents (for
example, titanium dioxide).
(b) Bleached yarn
Yarn which:
(i) has undergone a bleaching process, is made of
bleached fibres or, unless the context otherwise
requires, has been dyed white (whether or not in the
mass) or treated with a white dressing;
(ii) consists of a mixture of unbleached and bleached
fibres; or",
"(iii) is multiple (folded) or cabled and consists of
unbleached and bleached yarns.
(c) Coloured (dyed or printed) yarn
Yarn which:
(i) is dyed (whether or not in the mass) other than white or
in a fugitive colour, or printed, or made from dyed or
printed fibres;
(ii) consists of a mixture of dyed fibres of different colours
or of a mixture of unbleached or bleached fibres with
coloured fibres (marl or mixture yarns), or is printed in
one or more colours at intervals to give the impression
of dots;
(iii) is obtained from slivers or rovings which have been
printed; or
(iv) is multiple (folded) or cabled and consists of
unbleached or bleached yarn and coloured yarn.
The above definitions also apply, mutatis mutandis, to
monofilament and to strip or the like of Chapter 54.
(d) Unbleached woven fabric
Woven fabric made from unbleached yarn and which has not
been bleached, dyed or printed. Such fabric may have been
treated with a colourless dressing or a fugitive dye.
(e) Bleached woven fabric
Woven fabric which:
(i) has been bleached or, unless the context otherwise
requires, dyed white or treated with a white dressing,
in the piece;
(ii) consists of bleached yarn; or
(iii) consists of unbleached and bleached yarn.
(f) Dyed woven fabric
Woven fabric which:
(i) is dyed a single uniform colour other than white (unless
the context otherwise requires) or has been treated
with a coloured finish other than white (unless the
context otherwise requires), in the piece; or
(ii) consists of coloured yarn of a single uniform colour.
(g) Woven fabric of yarns of different colours
Woven fabric (other than printed woven fabric) which:
(i) consists of yarns of different colours or yarns of
different shades of the same colour (other than the
natural colour of the constituent fibres);
(ii) consists of unbleached or bleached yarn and coloured
yarn; or
(iii) consists of marl or mixture yarns.
(In all cases, the yarn used in selvedges and piece ends is not
taken into consideration.)
(h) Printed woven fabric
Woven fabric which has been printed in the piece, whether or
not made from yarns of different colours.
(The following are also regarded as printed woven fabrics: woven
fabrics bearing designs made, for example, with a brush or spray gun,
by means of transfer paper, by flocking or by the batik process.)
